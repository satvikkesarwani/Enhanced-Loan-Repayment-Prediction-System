# Enhanced-Loan-Repayment-Prediction-System 
Our project predicts loan defaults using a stacking ensemble of XGBoost and LightGBM with Logistic Regression as the meta-learner. It features advanced preprocessing, log transforms, categorical encoding, RandomizedSearchCV tuning, and GPU-accelerated training.

🚀 Overview

This system classifies loan repayment outcomes by combining:

XGBoost and LightGBM as base learners

Logistic Regression as a meta-learner

GPU-accelerated training for faster model convergence

🔧 Key Features

Advanced data preprocessing with log transformations

Robust categorical encoding & feature engineering

Stacking ensemble architecture for improved predictive power

RandomizedSearchCV for efficient hyperparameter tuning

Clean, modular notebook and code structure
